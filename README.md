# UPE Website

## About the App

The UPE Website & combined WebFront is composed of a react-app front-end and an Express React.js app for back-end. The two work in tandem to provide the best experience both on the public website side as well as the members-only section of the website.

The app utilizes Axios to communicate between front-end and back-end and a PostgreSQL database to store all the data for members/users/events/projects and all else. It also makes use of the SendGrid API to handle emails in and out of the app.

If you need to interact directly with the hosting environment for the app contact one of the codeowners to get the information required for it.
